# Pong_old
A pong game made in Java 

Hello. This is an old pong game that I made back in freshman year (shoutout to dan zaitz).
I just realized that the internet exists so I decided to upload my old projects here. This is the first one! Hopefully I will come back to update it now that I have two additional years of experience programming. 

Instructions for playing:
Download all files, import them into a project, and run the Engine class.

Controls:
Player 1 (left paddle) - W/S (up/down)
Player 2 (right paddle) - UP/DOWN arrow keys 

There's not much else to expain... It's pong.
